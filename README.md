In order to run the Nearest Prime Neighbours test, please download all the three .py files, and simply run the primes_around_sequence.py file in the terminal.
For testing some other sequences, please modify the generate_test_sequence function as instructed in the code.
You can also choose any randomness test combination from Randomness_tests.py as explained in the end of the code.
